# capstone2
Springboard Capstone 2 project utilizes supervised machine learning classification models to classify between 100 different zoo animals.
Five different sci-kit learn classification algorithms(1.Decision_Tree_Classifier, 2.SVM_Classifier, 3.GaussianNB_Classifier, 4.Random_Forest_Classifier, 5.KNN_Classifier) and two different deep learning algorithms (1.Keras_Sequential_Model, 2.Tensorflow_OneHotEncoding) classify 16 different animal attributes into seven different animal classes. 
Files included are:(1.jupyter notebook code with 11 different visualizations 2. powerpoint presentation slides 3. milestone report).
